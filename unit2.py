# Ok Ms. Roark,
# I know this isn't what you were expecting to see as my submission, however, I can assure you
# that it is done. I decided to spice things up a bit, so I wrote a quick web-page that accomplishes the same
# tasks as you assigned on the Moodle PDF. The real code is on Github, which is accessible on the website.

# If you aren't pleased with me doing it this way, I am more than happy to redo it the original way you assigned!

# Thanks,
# Tate Berenbaum
